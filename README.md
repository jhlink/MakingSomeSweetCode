# MakingSomeSweetCode

Basically, this repo will be a place where we'll track code that we write given program assignments. 

Think "Hunt Posters" but in terms of random programming tasks. 
They've all been implemented probably, but it's more about the experience than anything!!

Join in on the fun!!!
