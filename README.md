#	Learning to use Travis CI and other stuff...

TODO: 
-- Setup Travis CI for C++ application
-- Add in useful badges
	- Build status
	- Code Climate
	- Version
	- Issue Count
	- Coverage Status
-- Figure out how to use Read the Docs, if it's even useable for multiple languages... 


Notes:
- Build Statues and Code Climates badges were generated used badger. It's a shame that coverage status badge can only be added via a gem file. Will have to look into adding it from the .travs.yaml, or better yet, adding a coverage.yaml would probably be better. 
- Github Version badge was retrieved directly from https://badge.fury.io/
- Issue Count were retrieved from Code Climate. Will have to figure out how to add this to badger. 
- Coverage status badge was retrieved directly from coveralls.io
